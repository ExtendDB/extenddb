# Upgrade Manual

> See [NOTICE](../NOTICE.md) for important disclaimers.

## Current Status

Catalog 0.0.3 is current. The 0.0.2 to 0.0.3 upgrade is the first in-place catalog upgrade ExtendDB has, and **every existing PostgreSQL deployment must run it**, including deployments that never use vector indexes: the server refuses to start against a catalog version it was not built for.

See [Catalog 0.0.3](#catalog-003-current) below for what changes and the exact sequence.

## How Catalog Upgrades Work

### The Migration System

Migrations are SQL files in `crates/storage-postgres/migrations/`, applied in filename order:

```
001_schema.sql            ← the complete initial schema
002_vector_indexes.sql    ← vector index metadata, catalog 0.0.3
```

The `schema_history` table tracks which files have been applied. When `extenddb migrate` runs, it:

1. Reads all migration files embedded in the binary (via `include_str!`)
2. Checks `schema_history` for each filename
3. Applies any unapplied migrations in order
4. Records each applied filename in `schema_history`

Running `extenddb migrate` on an up-to-date catalog is a no-op.

### The Catalog Version

A single row in the `settings` table stores the catalog version:

```sql
SELECT value FROM settings WHERE key = 'catalog_version';
-- '0.0.2'
```

The binary embeds an expected catalog version (`CATALOG_VERSION` constant in `crates/storage-postgres/src/lib.rs`). At startup, the server compares the database value against the binary's expectation. If they don't match, the server refuses to start and directs the operator to run `extenddb migrate`.

### Version Semantics

The catalog version follows semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking schema changes that may require data migration or downtime
- **MINOR**: New tables or columns (backward-compatible, additive)
- **PATCH**: Index changes, constraint fixes, seed data updates

## Writing a New Migration

When you need to change the catalog schema, here's the process:

### 1. Create the migration file

Add a new SQL file with the next sequence number:

```
crates/storage-postgres/migrations/002_your_feature.sql
```

The file should be a single transaction:

```sql
-- Copyright 2026 ExtendDB contributors
-- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
-- Migration 002: Brief description of what this adds/changes.

BEGIN;

-- Your DDL here.
ALTER TABLE tables ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS new_column TEXT;

-- Bump the catalog version.
UPDATE settings SET value = '0.1.0' WHERE key = 'catalog_version';

COMMIT;
```

### 2. Register it in the migration runner

Add the file to `CATALOG_MIGRATIONS` in `crates/storage-postgres/src/migrations.rs`:

```rust
pub(crate) const CATALOG_MIGRATIONS: &[(&str, &str)] = &[
    (
        "001_schema.sql",
        include_str!("../../storage-postgres/migrations/001_schema.sql"),
    ),
    (
        "002_your_feature.sql",
        include_str!("../../storage-postgres/migrations/002_your_feature.sql"),
    ),
];
```

### 3. Bump the catalog version constant

In `crates/storage-postgres/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
pub const CATALOG_VERSION: CatalogVersion = CatalogVersion::new(0, 1, 0);
```

This must match the version written by your migration's `UPDATE settings` statement.

### 4. Update 001_schema.sql

The consolidated schema file is what fresh installs get. Add your new column/table/index to `001_schema.sql` as well, and update its `INSERT INTO settings` to seed the new version. This way fresh installs get the final schema in one pass, while existing deployments get there via the incremental migration.

### Design Considerations

**Idempotency.** Use `IF NOT EXISTS`, `IF EXISTS`, and `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` so migrations can be safely re-run.

**Backward compatibility.** Prefer additive changes (new columns with defaults, new tables) over destructive ones (dropping columns, renaming tables). A running server on the old binary should survive the schema change until it's restarted with the new binary.

**Transaction boundaries.** Wrap each migration in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`. If any statement fails, the entire migration rolls back and the catalog stays at the previous version.

**No data migrations in DDL files.** If a schema change requires backfilling data, do it in Rust code triggered by `extenddb migrate`, not in raw SQL. This gives you error handling, progress reporting, and the ability to batch large updates.

**Test both paths.** Every migration must be tested two ways:
1. Fresh install (`extenddb init`) — verifies `001_schema.sql` is correct
2. Upgrade (`extenddb migrate` on a catalog at the previous version) — verifies the incremental migration works

## General Upgrade Procedure

For future releases that include catalog changes:

1. **Stop the server**

```bash
extenddb stop --config extenddb.toml
```

2. **Back up databases**

```bash
pg_dump extenddb_catalog > catalog_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
pg_dump extenddb > data_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

3. **Build the new version**

```bash
git pull
cargo build --release
```

4. **Run migrations**

```bash
extenddb migrate --config extenddb.toml
```

5. **Verify**

```bash
extenddb verify --config extenddb.toml
```

6. **Start the server**

```bash
extenddb serve --config extenddb.toml
```

## Rollback Procedure

If an upgrade fails:

1. Stop the server
2. Restore from backup:

```bash
psql -c "DROP DATABASE extenddb_catalog;"
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE extenddb_catalog OWNER extenddb;"
psql -d extenddb_catalog -f catalog_backup_YYYYMMDD.sql
```

3. Rebuild the previous version and start it

## Version History

### Catalog 0.0.3 (Current)

Adds vector index metadata:

- New `vector_indexes` table: one row per vector index, holding its dimensions, distance function, vector attribute, search schema, projection, and build state.
- New `vector_indexes` column on `backups`: a snapshot of the source table's vector index configuration, taken when the backup is created.

**Every PostgreSQL deployment must apply this**, whether or not it uses vector indexes, because the server refuses to start against a catalog version it was not built for.

Upgrade sequence:

```bash
extenddb stop --config extenddb.toml
extenddb migrate --yes --config extenddb.toml
extenddb serve --config extenddb.toml
```

Run `extenddb migrate` without `--yes` first to see what is pending; it reports `catalog 0.0.2 -> 0.0.3` and changes nothing.

The upgrade is not reversible in place: a 0.0.2 binary refuses to start against a 0.0.3 catalog, by the same check in the other direction. Roll back by restoring the catalog backup taken before the upgrade, as described above. Downgrading is safe for data written before the upgrade; vector indexes created afterwards are not representable in 0.0.2 and are lost with the restore.

During the upgrade the migration also attempts to install the pgvector extension on the data database. Failure is reported as a notice and does not stop the upgrade: vector indexes are then refused at request time, and every other operation is unaffected. See the Admin Guide for what the notice means and what to do about it.

### Catalog 0.0.2 (Initial Release)

Complete schema: accounts, tables, indexes, tags, streams, IAM (users, groups, roles, policies, access keys, sessions, permissions boundaries), idempotency tokens, metrics, login attempts, backups, continuous backups, TTL support, settings.

The first release, so all 0.0.2 deployments were fresh installs.

## Behavior Changes by Release

Catalog upgrades change the schema; behavior changes alter how the running server
interprets existing data or configuration. Review these before upgrading a live
deployment, even when no catalog migration is required.

### v0.1.14 LeadingKeys now enforced on Query, batch and transaction operations

**What changed.** `dynamodb:LeadingKeys` is now evaluated on `Query`,
`BatchGetItem`, `BatchWriteItem`, `TransactGetItems` and `TransactWriteItems`.
Before this release those five operations carried no LeadingKeys value, so a
`ForAllValues:StringEquals dynamodb:LeadingKeys` condition on them was satisfied
vacuously and a principal fenced to its own partition could read or write any
partition through them. The item operations (`GetItem`, `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`,
`DeleteItem`) already enforced the key; they change only for a numeric (`N`)
partition key, which is now normalized (see below). Before this release the
item operations compared the number exactly as the request spelled it.

Details of how the key is bound, matching DynamoDB:

- A `Query` on the base table or a local secondary index binds LeadingKeys to
  the partition key value in the key condition (an LSI shares the base table's
  partition key).
- A `Query` on a global secondary index binds LeadingKeys to the queried
  index's partition key value (its first HASH attribute), not the base table's.
- `BatchGetItem` and `BatchWriteItem` are authorized per table over the set of
  keys that table receives; `TransactGetItems` and `TransactWriteItems` are
  authorized per item. A `ForAnyValue` condition therefore passes a mixed batch
  but not a mixed transaction.
- `Scan` and `SearchVectors` carry no LeadingKeys, because they target no single
  partition. A `ForAllValues` condition does not fence them (it is satisfied
  vacuously); fence a full-table read with `ForAnyValue:StringEquals` or a
  `Null` guard (`"Null": {"dynamodb:LeadingKeys": "false"}`) on the statement.
- A numeric (`N`) partition key is written into LeadingKeys the way the
  service writes it, which depends on the operation. `GetItem`, `PutItem`,
  `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`, `Query` and `BatchGetItem` use the normalized
  number, so `10`, `010`, `10.0` and `1E1` all compare as `"10"`.
  `BatchWriteItem`, `TransactGetItems` and `TransactWriteItems` keep the scale
  the request was written with, as Java's `BigDecimal` prints it: `010` and
  `1.0E1` compare as `"10"`, `10.0` as `"10.0"` and `1E1` as `"1E+1"`. The
  policy value is matched as written. Under a fence of `["10"]`, a client that
  sends `10.0` or `1E1` is allowed on the first group and denied on the second,
  as on DynamoDB.
- A `TransactWriteItems` or `TransactGetItems` with more than 100 items, a
  `BatchWriteItem` with more than 25 requests and a `BatchGetItem` with more
  than 100 keys return `ValidationException` before any policy is evaluated, as
  on DynamoDB. Before this release a principal without permission on the table
  received `AccessDeniedException` for such a request.

**Who is affected.** Any deployment with a principal whose policy fences
`dynamodb:LeadingKeys` with `ForAllValues:StringEquals` and whose Query, batch or
transaction requests previously crossed its own partition. After upgrade those
cross-partition requests return `AccessDeniedException`. Own-partition access is
unchanged, except for numeric partition keys.

A principal with a numeric LeadingKeys fence sees a change on the item
operations even if it never uses Query, batch or transactions. Under a fence of
`["10"]`, a `GetItem` on `010`, `10.0` or `1E1` was denied and is now allowed.
Under a fence written in a non-canonical form, such as `["010"]` or `["1E1"]`,
a request spelled the same way was allowed and is now denied: the policy value
is matched as written and no request is normalized to it.

**Migration.** No catalog migration is required. Before upgrading, audit
LeadingKeys policies with `extenddb manage list-user-policies` /
`list-role-policies` and confirm:

- A fence intended to cover reads and writes names the partition values the
  principal legitimately uses on Query, batch and transaction, not only item
  operations.
- Any policy relying on `Scan` or `SearchVectors` being fenced by a
  `ForAllValues` LeadingKeys condition is rewritten to `ForAnyValue` or adds a
  `Null` guard, since neither operation is fenced by `ForAllValues`.
- A numeric LeadingKeys value is written in the form each operation compares
  (see the numeric partition key item above). A fence of `["10"]` covers every
  spelling of 10 on the item operations, Query and BatchGetItem, and the
  spellings `10`, `010`, `+10` and `1.0E1` on batch writes and transactions. A
  fence value written as `010`, `10.0` or `1E1` matches nothing on the item
  operations, Query and BatchGetItem; rewrite it as `10`.

### v0.1.6 — IAM: bare operators on multivalued condition keys are no-ops (BR-7085)

**What changed.** A **bare** condition operator (no `ForAnyValue:` / `ForAllValues:`
qualifier) applied to a *multivalued* condition key — `dynamodb:Attributes` or
`dynamodb:LeadingKeys` — now **never matches**, matching real AWS IAM exactly. Before
v0.1.6, extenddb evaluated a bare operator as an implicit AND across the request's values,
so such a condition could match and appear to enforce a restriction.

**Who is affected.** Any deployment with an IAM policy that uses a bare operator (e.g.
`StringEquals`) on `dynamodb:Attributes` or `dynamodb:LeadingKeys`. A common pattern is a
denylist that *appeared* to protect an attribute:

```json
{ "Effect": "Deny", "Action": "dynamodb:GetItem", "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "dynamodb:Attributes": ["ssn"] } } }
```

Under the old behavior this could deny a single-attribute request; after the upgrade it is a
no-op (as it always was on real AWS). **This is a security-relevant change: policies relying
on the old semantics no longer restrict access.**

**Migration.** Rewrite affected policies to use a set qualifier before upgrading:

- Denylist (block if the request touches *any* listed attribute):
  `"ForAnyValue:StringEquals": { "dynamodb:Attributes": ["ssn"] }`
- Allowlist (allow only when *every* requested attribute is listed):
  `"ForAllValues:StringEquals": { "dynamodb:Attributes": ["pk", "sk"] }` on an `Allow`.

The same applies to `dynamodb:LeadingKeys`. Audit existing policies with
`extenddb manage list-user-policies` / `list-role-policies` and update any that use bare
operators on these keys. No catalog migration is required for this change.
